## WIP - This page is being actively developed

Parts of this page may or may not apply to menus, but this page focuses on the controlbar buttons and textures that are presented to the player ingame and pertain mostly to the resolution scaling & positioning behavior.

The results and findings on this page are based on the tests using only the 2560x1440 resolution.

This game uses a single commandbar texture and a single scheme (per faction) to dynamically scale across several screen resolutions. It does not work very well for resolutions above the officially supported which do not include widescreen aspect ratios.

Instead of trying to figure out how the existing scaling system works in practice, it is simply easier for Thyme to implement, simpler to maintain and more practical to create the necessary textures and configs for each of the established resolutions separately.
