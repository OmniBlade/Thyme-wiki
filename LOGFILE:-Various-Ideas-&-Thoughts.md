## WIP - This page is under active development 

***

This page is meant for more informal and initial mentioning of ideas and thoughts that aren't serious enough or the person just didn't develop it on it's own to be able to fully explain and present a case for it. These mostly wouldn't be part of Thyme in any way but are interesting nontheless to have an overview of the stance/reasoning the community have in mind sorrounding Generals Zero Hour. Some of the things discussed here might turn out to be substantial enough and will be escalated to the Enhancements List.

Items on this page are actively modified and deleted (strikethrough?).

# Various Ideas
## Controllability
* Ability to adjust location of the offmap cargo plane spawnpoint for caputrable tech buildings
## Gameplay Logic
* Ability to reverse the cargo loading procedure - Instead of the unit to be loaded moving to the transporter, the unit stands still and the transporter comes to it.
* Show Cargo Pips When Transporter Full Exception - Otherwise hidden unless selected (A Gameplay setting under Options Menu?)
## Problematic Units
### Tactical Nuke MiG 
* 
## Specific Module Behavior
* TODO: Aircraft Guard Behavior 

## System Info & Diagnostics
* Thyme should add a small non-annoying, barely noticable icon to some non-interesting part of the screen during gameplay to indicate that Thyme is active. Users watching various streams and recorded videos would know where to look for an be able to instantly know whether or not Thyme was used in the viewing video. This should help with chat spam and questions.

# Thoughts & Questions
* When reverse cargo loading behavior is implemented, should all transport units be given 2 control buttons necessary for choosing mode? If yes, which setting would be the default?
* Should infantry be very slowly healed when garrisoned in civilian buildings?
* Should China speaker towers be allowed to block line of sight to base defences? - not sure if they do that.
* Should deployable units when deployed undeploy and move out of the way when a unit paths through or should they ignore? Manual deployment?
