# Various Ideas And Thoughts 
## WIP - This page is under active development 

***

This page is meant for more informal and initial mentioning of ideas and thoughts that aren't serious enough or the person just didn't develop it on it's own to be able to fully explain and present a case for it. These mostly wouldn't be part of Thyme in any way but are interesting nontheless to have an overview of the stance/reasoning the community and Thyme's authors have in mind sorrounding Generals Zero Hour. Some of the things discussed here might turn out to be substantial enough and will be escalated to the Enhancements List.

Items on this page are actively modified and deleted (strikethrough?).

## Various Ideas
* Thyme should add a small non-annoying, barely noticable icon to some non-interesting part of the screen during gameplay to indicate that Thyme is active. The users watching various streams and recorded videos would know where to look for an be able to instantly know whether or not Thyme was used in the viewing video.

## Thoughts & Questions

* Should infantry be very slowly healed when garrisoned in civilian buildings?
