### WIP - This page is currently under active development

***

This page contains an unofficial list of what the community believes are clear-cut bugs or behavior that should be part of **Thyme's Core Defaults**, complicated cases when there is a lot of balanceing involved should go in the _**Various Ideas & Thoughts**_ page.

This is not an official _changelog_ or _planned-changes_ list. Fixes that are part of **Thyme's Core Defaults** are listed in an official changelog separately.

***

* Chinas: nuke cannons are able to move-out-of-the-way when deployed
* Chinas: nuke cannons keep redeploying when reloading
* EVAs: disable **_unit lost_** announcement for offmap cargo planes, it's not a buildable or controllable unit (also make sure it doesn't count as a score for units destroyed and units created)
* USA Missle Infantry trying to run somewhere inside Artillery base defence
* AI Cheating: USA Vanilla AI uses FuelAirBomb with it's delivery cargo plane generated at player opponent map edge instead of the AI's edge (I got this in another mod, but I recall this thing happened a lot back in the days when I didn't play much mods)
* AI Cheating: Black Lotus caputres buildings while walking
* AI Stupid: USA Raptors will routinely fly past enemy defences when unarmed only to be shot down, after shooting at something in their base.
