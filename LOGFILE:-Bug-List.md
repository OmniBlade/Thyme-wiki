### WIP - This page is currently under active development

***

This page contains a list of clear-cut bugs or behavior that may most certainly be considered a bug by the community, if you have a complicated case please add and explain it in the _**Various Ideas & Thoughts**_ page first.

***

* china/nukegen: fix nuke cannons reload deploy/undeploy bug
* EVAs: disable **_unit lost_** announcement for offmap cargo planes, it's not a buildable or controllable unit (also make sure it doesn't count as a score for units destroyed and units created)
