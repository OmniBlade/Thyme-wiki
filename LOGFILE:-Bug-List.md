### WIP - This page is currently under active development

***

This page contains an unofficial list of what the community believes are clear-cut bugs or behavior that should be part of **Thyme's Core Defaults**, complicated cases when there is a lot of balanceing involved should go in the _**Various Ideas & Thoughts**_ page.

***

* Chinas: nuke cannons are able to move-out-of-the-way when deployed
* Chinas: nuke cannons keep redeploying when reloading
* EVAs: disable **_unit lost_** announcement for offmap cargo planes, it's not a buildable or controllable unit (also make sure it doesn't count as a score for units destroyed and units created)
