Commit messages should be in the present tense and describe what the commit does, not what you did. For example "Fixes bug x, implements y" opposed to "Fixed bug x, implemented y". The first line of the commit should give a brief idea of what the commit does and if any additional detail is needed to clarify the contents of the commit, it should follow after an empty line. Include the issues number in the brief description if the commit pertains to one.
