### WIP - This page is under active development - contents may change completely

***

This page explains the purpose, relationship and implementation ideas as well as end-user behavior of the proposed component: **Thyme Patch**

If this proposition becomes a reality, this page will change the necessary wording and title to reflect the project's state.

## Overview:

**Thyme Patch** would be an unofficial balance/bugfix/enhancement patch that would contain those that were not justified for inclusion into the **Thyme's Core Defaults**,

## Implementation:
- It would be as an addon/extension component to **Thyme Core** so that it would never overwrite anything that is part of **Thyme's Core Defaults**.

- The same whay **Thyme Core** is, **Thyme Patch** would be if possible implemented to work on a lower level than community mods would, as if it was a real official patch, in order to provide a stable platform for mods that wish to base their mods ontop of **Thyme Core** and **Thyme Patch**
