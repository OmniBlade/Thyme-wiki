### WIP - This page's purpose is currently under active development - Contents may change completely

This page is an unofficial(?) list of various enhancements to the features and capabilities, to get a full overview of all of the improvements that Thyme is bringing to the original engine, irrespective of whether or not the enhancement is actually being used by Thyme or any of it's components in practice.

Enhancements that are part of **Thyme's Core Defaults** are a complicated matter which the community maintaining this wiki cannot decide on their own and those are listed in an official changelog separately.

Enhancements that may be part of the proposed **Thyme Patch** component would also be listed in it's own official changelog.
