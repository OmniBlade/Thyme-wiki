# Enhancements Todo List (WIP)
## _This page is currently under active development_

Any new Enhancements ideas should be added to the unsorted section at first.
After it is determined that an item corresponds to criteria in other sections, it will be moved appropriately.

The enhancements ideas on this page may be later discovered to be already possible without engine modification, therefore they are split to separate sections. While most of the Enhancements made possible by Thyme are meant for the use by the modding community, a minority of them might become Thyme's default in ways determined later, therefore these are additionally separated by using a tag label "`Thyme's Default`".

What may become a "`Thyme's Default`" Enhancement is probably the most difficult decision and should not be made individualy, it should go through rigorous negotiations first; nobody* should be tagging Enhancements items with this label unless it is a collective action previously agreed upon and/or it's permitted to do so by the Administrators. This label would only be applicable to Enhnacements that would be generally accepted by a large portion of the community; and/or that they represent a proper way of doing something that was not considered an outright bug, and/or that they come with various types of evidence that the developers intended to make it so in future but weren't able to reach that point.

Whether or not non-engine-modification-requiring Enhancements will be used in any part of Thyme, optionally or otherwise, will be determined in future. These can considered "Enhancements to the official/original gameplay", as they are already possible with the original engine, but aren't implemented in gameplay logic.

The biggest reason for keeping the non-engine-modification-requiring Enhancements is for reference and overview purposes, as well as to avoid duplicates.

## Unsorted Enhancements List 
* Ability to reverse the cargo loading procedure - Instead of the unit to be loaded moving to the transporter, the unit stands still and the transporter comes to it.
* Show Cargo Pips When Transporter Full Exception - Otherwise hidden unless selected (A Gameplay setting under Options Menu?)
