# Enhancements Todo List (WIP)
## _This page is currently under active development_

These list should include core/basic various enhnacements of any kind that should and could be generally accepted by a large portion of the community, previously, or throught future negotiations; and/or that they represent a proper way of doing something that isn't considered a bug, and/or that they come with various types of evidence that the developers intended to make it so in future but weren't able to reach that point.

The enhancements ideas on this page may or may not require necessary engine modification, therefore they are split to separate sections. Additionally, while most of the Enhancements made possible by Thyme are meant for the modding community, some of them might become Thyme's future defaults, therefore these are additionally separated.

What may become a "**Thyme's default**" Enhancement is probably the hardest part to know right now and should go through rigorous negotiations later on; nobody* should be tagging Enhancements items with this label unless it is a collective action previously agreed upon and/or it's permitted to do so by the Administrators.


Any new Enhancements ideas should be added to the unsorted section at first.
After it is determined that an item corresponds to criteria in other sections, it will be moved appropriately.

Whether or not non-engine-modification-requiring Enhancements will be used in any part of Thyme, optionally or otherwise, will be determined in future.
